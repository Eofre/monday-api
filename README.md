# Mini Quizlet Backend

This is a server repository for my portfolio project. This project is a mini analogue of the Quizlet service. It is built using Nest JS, Sequelize and MySQL.

## Project Overview

The backend provides the necessary API endpoints for user registration, authentication, and managing flashcards and flashcard sets.

## Technology Stack

The backend utilizes the following technologies:

- **Nest JS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **Sequelize**: A promise-based ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for Node.js that supports multiple database systems, including MySQL.
- **MySQL**: A popular open-source relational database management system.

## Installation

To run the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the backend repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd monday-api`.
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Start the backend server: `npm run start:dev`.

## Frontend Repository

The frontend repository for the Mini Quizlet project can be found [here](https://github.com/Eofre/monday-client). It provides the user interface and interacts with the backend API endpoints.
